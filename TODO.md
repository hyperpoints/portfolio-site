the to-do list of what remains isn't so bad. i need:

1. finish sorting out the window system so you can open/close windows
2. add some kind of icon-renderer which renders an array of files/projects (hosted in the /public directory during development. /public will be replaced by github url later)
3. fix up a last couple of minor improvements to the window system, and consider styling it to look different from macOS. i could make it slightly more original
4. deploy to vercel

i guess that's it! not so bad
