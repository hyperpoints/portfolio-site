<h1>wireframe mode!</h1>

<p>the idea of wireframe mode is to add a toggle-able setting on my portfolio site which enables some kind of wireframe
  feature to reveal to users how much effort went into building all the different components and pieces of the desktop
  interface. </p>

<p>it could highlight the different features and components which were built and link out to the relevant code</p>

<p>it might also be nice to add a markdown renderer or something as an alternative to html files</p>

<p>here's another idea for you... i think i should change how html renders to be injected instead of using iframes. I
  think that might solve the problem of the iframe event capture thing. the one causing troubles for the uh.. the um..
  who cares. you know the one.</p>
