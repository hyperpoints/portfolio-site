  <h1>üê≥ Theatrical Intelligence</h1>

  <p>
    Here we have our new glorbo-OS system! I am hoping very much to create many features such as animated terminal
    systems, toy terminals, charts, graphs, loading animations to make you say "wow", inspiring d3.js
    animations, and more!
  </p>

  <p>one of our goals here is to inspire everyone in the world to imagine the possibilities. we will do this by creating
    an operating system from the future, something like in death stranding 2 or star trek, and beyond. the idea is to
    think of amazing stories like talos principle, Piranesi, moby dick, persona, and many more. i had an idea
    for a special window system. when you make a window full screen it covers up the previous full screen window and
    sends it back one in the stack. there's a stack of window cards you can access at all times in a vertical menu like
    from daimon</p>
