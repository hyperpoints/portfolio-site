<p><strong>CHAPTER 1 - </strong><em>catching fire</em></p><p>Dearest Readers,</p><p>Sherlock Holmes has at times been a good friend to me and I’ve always marveled at his antics, but few stories compare to the time when he got tangled up in the world of computers. Yes, the case of the Great Computer Virus of Nottingham Corner Square was not a tale one could easily forget! It was an anomaly, in that it was a case he never truly solved to his own satisfaction, thanks in part to his complete inability to understand computers and partially due to the otherworldly circumstances surrounding the case.</p><p>I remember it like it was yesterday, because Holmes was eating an enormous sandwich, I believe it was the size of the typewriter on which I recount this tale to you now. He was looking through his famous magnifying glass at the brand new computer which had just been shipped to us by a rather strange professor we’d met over at Oxford College known then as Professor Naomi Doctorson, Computer Expert. The device in question was printing out line after line of bright green text onto a screen which was otherwise vacant.</p><p><code>ACCESS DENIED.</code></p><p><code>ACCESS DENIED.</code></p><p><code>ACCESS DENIED.</code></p><p>These words were printing out over and over again and Sherlock Holmes was looking at them through his magnifying glass, “I can’t believe this! I can’t believe something so horrible would happen to me! And on my <em>birthday</em> no less! Watson! Fetch me the jar of spicy mustard!”</p><p>I looked up from the newspaper and glanced over at Holmes with a confused expression on my face, “What?”</p><p>“You heard me Watson! Hurry up! Or else, what am I paying you for old pal!?” He started tapping away at the keyboard without looking back at me.</p><p>I stroked my mustache, “Paying..me? You’re not paying me!”</p><p>He turned around dramatically to stare at me through his magnifying glass, which he was still holding up to his eye, “What? Oh! Yes, yes of course yes. Well, what about it then my good man?” He lit his pipe and started typing on the computer again between puffs of smoke. He was still getting the same error, yet he kept hitting the enter key.</p><p>With an exasperated sigh I folded up my newspaper, got to my feet, and walked over to the attached kitchen area in our shared living space. It was a small 2-bedroom apartment in London, about the size of a postage stamp, maybe bigger. The problem with comparing an apartment to a postage stamp I suppose is that postage stamps are just so <em>small</em> aren’t they? I always wondered why people called it a postage stamp apartment, after all, aren’t postage stamps <em>much smaller</em> than most buildings you’ve ever been into? I don’t know. Maybe it’s just me, but now I am starting to sound like Sherlock Holmes with all this philosophizing!</p><p>You have to understand, Sherlock Holmes is the one with the brains, I’m just the guy who gets the spicy mustard out of the fridge and writes about all his adventures for the daily newspaper. Please, don’t consider the idea that perhaps I, Watson, am the real brains behind this operation because it’s simply not the case! Yes indeed, Sherlock Holmes has always been the true detective, whereas I have always been more of a sidekick figure.</p><p>I grabbed the spicy mustard from the refrigerator and brought it over to Sherlock Holmes, who accepted the jar without looking up and started pouring the mustard onto his giant sandwich, “Now that’s the stuff!” he said puffing on his pipe, “That’s how they do it in Old London Town!”</p><p>I raised my eyebrows above my newspaper which I had just resumed reading, and noticed that Holmes was puffing so much smoke out of his pipe that all I could see in his direction was the glow of green text on a computer screen.</p><p>That was when the doorbell buzzer rang out.</p><p>“Bwah!” Sherlock jumped in surprise, knocking the jar of mustard onto the floor in the process, shattering it into a million pieces, “You didn’t plan some kind of surprise birthday party for me did you Watson?” He said this while looking down at the broken jar through his magnifying glass.</p><p>I frowned, “No, I did not!” Sherlock Holmes puffed on his pipe in response. The door buzzed again and I found myself getting to my feet.</p><p>“Do I really have to do everything around here!?” by the time I opened the door however, my annoyance was all but forgotten.</p><p>Standing there in the doorway was none other than Dr Naomi Doctorson, Computer Expert, the one who had sent us the computer! She was holding a big stack of boxes labeled <em>computer equipment</em>.</p><p>“Why, hello Professor Naomi! We weren’t expecting anyone so late! Still, you must have come a long way, why don’t you come in.”</p><p>“Thank you Doctor Watson, I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t important!” She stepped into the apartment balancing the boxes. It was at this precise moment that Sherlock Holmes appeared rather dramatically out of a huge cloud of smoke, “Access Denied….another one of your computer viruses I presume Professor?” He said this in his wisest tone of voice.</p><p>Naomi laughed and set down the boxes, “No Sherlock Holmes, I believe that’s the message you get when you don’t know how to use your computer yet! Speaking of computers, there is a rather strange computer virus which has been causing trouble over in Nottingham Corner Square.”</p><p>Sherlock Holmes Puffed on his pipe, “Is that over in Old London Town?”</p><p>Dr Naomi frowned, “No. It’s in Nottingham. I thought you were a detective?”</p><p>Sherlock Holmes puffed on his pipe and nodded thoughtfully. There was a long pause which stretched on for one hour.</p><p>“Well, anyways.” Naomi started up again once we were all done thinking, “This computer virus, it’s a real humdinger of an operation. These computer bastards have been infecting every computer from here to France with a computer virus called <em>computer worm attack</em>. Holmes, we need your help to solve this, but if you’re going to help you’re going to have to brush up on your computer skills to do it! Watson, we may just need your expertise as well, after all, who better to cure a computer virus than a doctor?”</p><p>Sherlock Holmes and I both nodded wisely in agreement with Dr Naomi, and Holmes spoke up, “Yes, it sounds like quite the humdinger of a problem indeed! My detective sense tells me we have a heck of a troublemaker on our hands, and it’s up to us to stop these bastards!” he took a drink of root beer then said, “So…what are the clues?”</p><p>Dr Naomi pushed her glasses up on her face, “Well. So far we have three clues. The first clue is this CD-ROM of computer memory…” She handed it to Holmes, who began to examine it with his magnifying glass and make a series of observations, the kind only Sherlock Holmes would make.</p><p>“Yes..Yes of course. It looks like this computer disc has a scrape on it, which means it was removed from the computer in a hurry. Written on the side are the words <em>virus.exe</em>. It’s written in print, not in cursive, which makes me think whoever created the computer virus does not know how to write in cursive! This leads me to the conclusion that the computer virus was written by someone who is too busy to learn cursive.” He paused and looked up at Dr Naomi, “How am I doing so far?”</p><p>She scratched her head, “Well, you were right about the fact that it says virus.exe on there-”</p><p>Detective Sherlock Holmes smiled, “Looks like I’ve done it again!”</p><p>Dr Naomi shook her head, “Not quite. I actually wrote this disc myself, this is simply a copy of the virus that I made at my office at Oxford College so I could bring it here for you and Dr Watson, the famous detective duo, to examine. The reason why the CD-ROM is scratched is because I dropped it down a flight of stairs earlier when it fell out of a box of computer equipment.”</p><p>The look of surprise from Holmes shook the room like an earthquake, “Huh!? What do you mean?” He looked at Dr Naomi through his magnifying glass.</p><p>“Well! I was standing by the window in my office at Oxford holding a bunch of heavy boxes full of expensive computer equipment. I remember making a comment to myself, something like ‘I sure hope I don’t drop and break any of this expensive equipment!’ At that exact moment a huge gust of wind blew the door open, causing me to jump in surprise and accidentally tip the box I was holding ever so slightly towards the window. Since this CD-ROM disc was at the top of the stack, it slid off the top of the box and out the window, fell a few stories, broke out of the case it was in, then bounced down a long flight of stairs rolling all along the way. By the time I looked outside the CD-ROM was already bouncing down an enormous flight stairs across campus. I stuck my head out the window and started yelling at various people walking nearby, trying to get their attention to see if anyone could try to stop it before it bounced too many times, because I was scared of it getting too scratched to the point where it wouldn’t work anymore. More than that however, I was worried some unsuspecting person would pick up the disc, take it home to their computer, and install the computer virus on their computer by mistake! Luckily I was able to run outside and grab it before anything bad happened.”</p><p>Holmes looked at Dr Naomi and wrinkled his brow inquisitively, “So…that’s why the disc is scratched?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Well, that’s one mystery solved!” Holmes puffed on his pipe some more. The room was now so full of smoke that we couldn’t see anything at all.</p><p>“So, what other clues are there?” Sherlock said, smoking on his pipe.</p><p>Dr Naomi pointed through the cloud of smoke at the box of computer equipment, “Well, the second clue is in that box. It’s a letter from the person who wrote the virus, delivered via the postal service. You see… the virus itself was originally sent over old fashioned mail, which is why it’s so hard to trace.”</p><p>“What box?” I said, coughing. “I can’t see anything through all this smoke!”</p><p>“Watson my good man, open a window why don’t you?” said Holmes voice floated over to me from somewhere in that huge cloud of smoke.</p><p>“No! Why don’t you do it?! You’re the one smoking that blasted pipe!!”</p><p>There was a sound of footsteps going towards the window followed by the sound of a window opening, then by the distant sight of a match lighting up as Holmes tried to relight his pipe, finally by muffled swearing from Sherlock, and a burning match falling through the smoke onto the rug, which immediately burst into flames. That was when all the smoke alarms in the entire building started going off.</p><p>“Wow!” Dr Naomi started scrambling to re-pack her box of computer equipment, glancing at the fire which was now spreading.</p><p>“Sorry! Sorry! I’m trying to put it out,” Holmes said this as he poured a can of root beer he had been drinking onto the flames, causing them to burn even faster. When that didn’t work he also tried waving his hands at the fire at top speed in a misguided attempt to create a gust of wind.</p><p>“Oh for god’s sake!” I yelled, fumbling around in the kitchen cabinets for the fire extinguisher. Finally I found it beneath the sink and tossed it to Naomi who put the fire out easily in about ten seconds.</p><p>Sherlock Holmes watched the fire go out through his magnifying glass.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at Sherlock, “That fire was an accident, was it not? As long as that’s the case, we have more pressing matters at hand, namely, this blasted computer virus case we’ve been trying to solve. Naomi, are you doing alright? I realize you’ve walked into quite a mess here.”</p><p>Sherlock Holmes chimed in, “Yes, Watson’s right of course, really sorry about all this! I’ve been in computer mode all day you see, easy to get careless”</p><p>“Ah, yes. Well. Hmph.” Dr Naomi set down the fire extinguisher on the coffee table and picked up her box of computer equipment, noticed something in the box, set the box down again, grabbed it. It was a copy of a book entitled COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE. She tossed it at Sherlock Holmes who dodged it instinctively, as it launched towards his head. As a result the book went sailing through the open window behind him.</p><p>“My leg!” somebody yelled from outside.</p><p>“AH. I’m sorry! Oh my god!” Naomi through her arms up in disbelief, “I can’t believe this! Look, I think I’m going to just go home and we can try this again some other time,” she shook her head and started to gather up her boxes.</p><p>“Wait, Naomi,” I looked away from Sherlock, who was standing dramatically with his hands on his hips and his detective hat on, “When should we meet next? Are we still on the case?” I will admit dear reader, that at the time I genuinely didn’t know anymore.</p><p>“Yes of course, I need both of your help after all the successful cases you’ve solved together, “ she started for the door, “But let’s get it together okay? I suppose I’ll include myself in that since I hit that guy in the legs with a copy of computer knowledge. Let’s meet at my office at Oxford tomorrow afternoon and take it from the top. We’ve got some computer bastards to catch after all” she laughed, and with that was out the door leaving Sherlock and I with burnt carpet, a broken mustard jar, and a blinking cursor.</p>
