  <h2>README</h2>

  <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Ian McCauley and I built this whole thing from scratch because I
    had a bit of time on my hands. Feel free to click around! Please note, I was so focused on creating a whole
    desktop experience that I haven't finished adding content to this site. It's a work in progress.</p>
  <p>You may be interested to know that there is an actual static file-system underlying this UI! I'm able to swap out
    files on the fly and my portfolio site is capable of displaying whatever files are in the system. The reason it's a
    static file-system rather than a whole backend API is for the purpose of simplicity. I figured it would be enough
    for a portfolio site to host the files as a static pre-indexed file-system hosted on <a
      href="https://github.com/hyperpoints/portfolio-site" target="_blank">github</a> pages.</p>
  <p>Even so, don't think for a minute that I haven't considered expanding this project! It has crossed my mind more
    than once.</p>
