  <h2>README</h2>

  <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Ian McCauley and I built this whole thing from scratch because I
    had a bit of time on my hands. Feel free to click around! Please note, I was so focused on creating a whole
    desktop experience that I haven't finished adding content to this site. It's a work in progress.</p>
  <p>You may be interested to know that there is an actual static file-system underlying this UI! I'm able to swap out
    files on the fly and my portfolio site is capable of displaying whatever files are in the system. The reason it's a
    static file-system rather than a whole backend API is for the purpose of simplicity. I figured it would be enough
    for a portfolio site to host the files as a static pre-indexed file-system hosted on <a
      href="https://github.com/hyperpoints/portfolio-site" target="_blank">github</a> pages.</p>
  <p>Even so, don't think for a minute that I haven't considered expanding this project! It has crossed my mind more
    than once.</p>

  <h2>FEATURES</h2>
  <p>Allow me to share a few features of this portfolio system!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Resizable windows (drag on the lower edge of any window)</li>
    <li>Multiple file types! Different file types such as HTML files, PDFs, images, and links all have their own method
      of rendering and are capable of being set up with unique features.</li>
    <li>Double click on the window title bar to minimize/maximize any window.</li>
    <li>Fully functional taskbar!</li>
    <li>Click and drag to re-arrange items on the taskbar.</li>
    <li>File Explorer</li>
    <li>"Mobile mode" which handles a few things different on smaller screens.</li>
    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/hyperpoints/portfolio-site/blob/main/scripts/updateFileManifests.js"
        target="_blank">script</a> which indexes the file system which I run when I'm updating the files.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperpoints/portfolio-site/actions" target="_blank">github workflow</a> which runs
      automatically and re-deploys the site to github pages
      whenever i make changes</li>
  </ul>
